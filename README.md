# TwoSidedTimer
This simple timer allows you to implement code useful especially for moving platforms type of objects in Unity.

If for example you want to move a platform from left to right or up and down and make it move based on a set interval.
Another option is changing the offset of a texture to make a scrolling texture as I did - which is 
why I wanted to create this timer in the first place.

This timer is the best I have come to create so far and since I haven't found anything similar to this online
I decided to post it for future programmers who might need it.
If you are a more advanced programmer and have a simpler way to do it, I'd love to take advice as well.
